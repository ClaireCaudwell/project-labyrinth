# Project (Rainbow ðŸŒˆ) Labyrinth
This weeks project was aimed to help us tie together skills we've previously learnt when we've been accessing and fetching data from a backend. We were tasked as a pair to access the labyrinth actions game data and show it for the user to interact with, creating the (rainbow labyrinth) text-based adventure!

## What we created
Of course we created the text-based adventure, rainbow labyrinth, but we implemented alot of differnent logic and code to achieve out end goal. This included:
1. Doing a two different post requests to the labyrinth start and action endpoints and using thunks to help with the asynchronous nature of the fetch request. This was because once the post was done and he data was returned we were storing the data in the redux store. 
2. Created the redux global store for where we would store the player name inputted by the user, the data returned from the post request and the history of where the user has been so we could create a back button. 
3. React components and a flow which works in sync with the data being returned from the post request. 
4. Displaying the data to the user at the right time in the game.
5. Implementing a loader, which includes a lottie animation, that shows whilst the post request is being done to the backend. 
6. Using useSelector and useDispatch to access and send data to the redux store. 
7. Working with styled components and creating their own files which are imported into their respective components. 
8. Planning and working together to achieve the end goal.
9. Implemented responsiveness for mobile, tablet and desktop devices. 

## How we went about it:
1. Planned and discussed ideas.
2. Googled.
3. Sought help and advice from peers.
